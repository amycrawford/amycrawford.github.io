I am a Ph.D. Candidate in Statistics at Iowa State University. My research is focused on developing interpretable machine learning and Bayesian methodologies for interesting probelems arising in forensics, clinical trial design, and business applications. My doctoral research is based in statistical foundations for the evaluation of handwriting as evidence. This work is conducted at the [Center for Statistics and Applications in Forensic Evidence (CSAFE)](https://forensicstats.org/).  

I received my Bachelor's degree in statistics and mathematics from North Dakota State University in 2015, and my Master's degree in statistics from Iowa State University in 2017.
